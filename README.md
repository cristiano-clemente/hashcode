## Practice Round: [Pizza Problem](practice-round/pizza.pdf)

### Problem Statement:

The goal is to,

```
cut correct slices out of the pizza maximizing the total number of cells in all slices.
```

### How we tackled the problem:

- The pizza is mapped onto a grid.

- Each of the grid lines are scanned from left to right.

- When a valid pizza slice is encountered, it is added to the output file and the scanning of the line restarts from where it left off.

## Online Qualification Round / Extended Round: [Photo Slideshow](qualification-round/photo_slideshow.pdf)

### Problem Statement:

The goal is to,

```
Given a list of photos and the tags associated with each photo, arrange the photos into
a slideshow that is as interesting as possible.

### How we tackled the problem:

- The photos are divided up into 2 different lists: vertical and horizontal.

- The vertical photos are grouped into pairs, maximizing the combined number of tags.

- The slideshow starts with the first horizontal photo.

- All the remaining photos are scored against the current last photo in the slideshow.

- The following photo is the one that maximizes the score when combined with the previous one.
